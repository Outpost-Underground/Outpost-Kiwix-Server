OUTPOST OFFLINE LIBRARY (USB EDITION)
====================================

This USB stick contains the files needed to run a local offline
library server using Kiwix.

On this USB you will find:

  Outpost-Kiwix-Server\
    kiwix-tools-win\
    ZIMs\
    OUTPOST-KIWIX-MENU.bat
    README-OUTPOST.txt

HOW TO USE
----------

1. Plug this USB stick into a Windows computer.
2. Open the "Outpost-Kiwix-Server" folder.
3. Double-click "OUTPOST-KIWIX-MENU.bat".
4. In the menu, you can:

   - [1] "Start server".
   - [2] "Stop server".
   - [3] "Rebuild library from ZIMs".
   - [4] "Open ZIMs folder" and copy your .zim files into that folder.
   - [6] "Download prepper ZIM pack" (if online).

5. The script will show you how to connect:

   - From THIS computer (the server):
       http://localhost:8090

   - From OTHER devices on the same network:
       The menu will try to auto-detect your IPv4 address and
       show a direct link (for example http://192.168.1.100:8090).

IMPORTANT
---------

- PDF viewing can be tricky depending on the browser being used.
  If clicking on a PDF inside a ZIM file results in error then
  try either a different browser such as Duck Duck Go or Firefox,
  or right click the PDF and open in a new tab/window. 

- The Kiwix server set up by this USB does NOT use a username/password
  by default. If your browser asks you for a username and password
  when you open the address above, it is almost certainly coming from
  your network's proxy or filter, not from Kiwix itself.

STOPPING THE SERVER
-------------------

Return to the menu and choose [2] "Stop server", or close the
"Kiwix Server" process.

NOTES
-----

- This USB is NOT locked to a specific computer; you can plug it into
  any Windows machine and run the menu.
- Your ZIM files may be large; ensure the USB has enough free space.
- The optional "prepper pack" downloads a curated set of ZIM files
  (Ready.gov, food prep, knots, medicine, post-disaster, water,
  urban prepper, low-tech magazine, military medicine, etc.)
  that fits easily on a 128 GB drive.

Stay curious and stay prepared.
